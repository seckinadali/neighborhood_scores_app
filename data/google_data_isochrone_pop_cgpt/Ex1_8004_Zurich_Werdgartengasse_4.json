Very friendly, especially the bartenders at the pool bar where we had a few drinks in the evening. My issues were first, the room. It definitely didn't look like the pictures that were showed online of bright airy rooms. It was extremely small and bare, just a bed, TV and small desk, the floors were black and the walls dark green so it felt like a dungeon. Just dark and depressing. My second issue...we arrived after a long train ride and wanted coffee. During the course of the day we spent about $25 on coffee at the restaurant and bar. It wasn't until before checkout the next morning that I found a room downstairs that had a complimentary coffee machine. Maybe the staff could have mentioned that? Especially when we're sitting in the very next room paying for it??",

We stopped there on Saturday evening for a pre dinner drink, the bar was barely half full, we sat outside and although we had been seen, no one approached us for a good 20 mins. After finally ordering a cocktail and a glass of wine, we waited another 20 mins for it to be served to us, while the bar person was arranging glasses on the bar shelf. Overall, a very poor experience and I doubt we'll be back.",

On arrival at the hotel at 9.30am we were absolutely delighted to find that our room was ready.  The room, though small, was clean and had everything we needed.  Staff were very friendly and helpful, lent us an adaptor plug for our chargers (we have several but none that fitted the Swiss version!).    The hotel is very conveniently located - walking distance from the main station or there is a station (Selnau) within 100m of the hotel.  Great location to catch a tram or to walk into the city.   We would definitely stay here again.",

Very friendly, especially the bartenders at the pool bar where we had a few drinks in the evening. My issues were first, the room. It definitely didn't look like the pictures that were showed online of bright airy rooms. It was extremely small and bare, just a bed, TV and small desk, the floors were black and the walls dark green so it felt like a dungeon. Just dark and depressing. My second issue...we arrived after a long train ride and wanted coffee. During the course of the day we spent about $25 on coffee at the restaurant and bar. It wasn't until before checkout the next morning that I found a room downstairs that had a complimentary coffee machine. Maybe the staff could have mentioned that? Especially when we're sitting in the very next room paying for it??",

Staff were very friendly and helpful, lent us an adaptor plug for our chargers (we have several but none that fitted the Swiss version!).

Every dish was excellently prepared, making each bite a delightful experience.\n\nHowever, the overall experience was marred by the excessive wait times. Even for something as basic as water, we found ourselves waiting unusually long. Additionally, our drink orders were forgotten multiple times, suggesting a potential issue with staff being overwhelmed.\n\nThe restaurant itself was packed to the brim, which not only impacted the service but also affected the ambiance. It felt more like a place to leave quickly after eating rather than a spot to linger for additional drinks.\n\nMy suggestion would be to consider removing a few tables. This would give the staff more space to move and attend to guests more efficiently. I believe that such a change could positively impact service quality and encourage longer stays by guests, ultimately reflecting in better tips and increased sales.\n\nIn summary, Don Leone has the potential to be a top-notch dining destination, provided some adjustments are made to enhance the customer experience.",

Very friendly, especially the bartenders at the pool bar where we had a few drinks in the evening. My issues were first, the room. It definitely didn't look like the pictures that were showed online of bright airy rooms. It was extremely small and bare, just a bed, TV and small desk, the floors were black and the walls dark green so it felt like a dungeon. Just dark and depressing. My second issue...we arrived after a long train ride and wanted coffee. During the course of the day we spent about $25 on coffee at the restaurant and bar. It wasn't until before checkout the next morning that I found a room downstairs that had a complimentary coffee machine. Maybe the staff could have mentioned that? Especially when we're sitting in the very next room paying for it??",

After finally ordering a cocktail and a glass of wine, we waited another 20 mins for it to be served to us, while the bar person was arranging glasses on the bar shelf. Overall, a very poor experience and I doubt we'll be back.",

On arrival at the hotel at 9.30am we were absolutely delighted to find that our room was ready.  The room, though small, was clean and had everything we needed.  Staff were very friendly and helpful, lent us an adaptor plug for our chargers (we have several but none that fitted the Swiss version!).    The hotel is very conveniently located - walking distance from the main station or there is a station (Selnau) within 100m of the hotel.  Great location to catch a tram or to walk into the city.   We would definitely stay here again.",

Very friendly, especially the bartenders at the pool bar where we had a few drinks in the evening. My issues were first, the room. It definitely didn't look like the pictures that were showed online of bright airy rooms. It was extremely small and bare, just a bed, TV and small desk, the floors were black and the walls dark green so it felt like a dungeon. Just dark and depressing. My second issue...we arrived after a long train ride and wanted coffee. During the course of the day we spent about $25 on coffee at the restaurant and bar. It wasn't until before checkout the next morning that I found a room downstairs that had a complimentary coffee machine. Maybe the staff could have mentioned that? Especially when we're sitting in the very next room paying for it??",

We stopped there on Saturday evening for a pre dinner drink, the bar was barely half full, we sat outside and although we had been seen, no one approached us for a good 20 mins. After finally ordering a cocktail and a glass of wine, we waited another 20 mins for it to be served to us, while the bar person was arranging glasses on the bar shelf. Overall, a very poor experience and I doubt we'll be back.",

Staff were very friendly and helpful, lent us an adaptor plug for our chargers (we have several but none that fitted the Swiss version!).    The hotel is very conveniently located - walking distance from the main station or there is a station (Selnau) within 100m of the hotel.  Great location to catch a tram or to walk into the city.   We would definitely stay here again.",

              "text": "For me, the Enge and Wipkingen stations are the gems among the Zurich city stations: architecturally interesting, as well as traffic-wise. However, the two Ws offer no consolation for the commuter's heart, more of a service wasteland. But that's why there is narrowness,\nStadelhofen, Oerlikon and also Hardbr\u00fccke. But if you want to travel again, you should change trains in Wiedikon. But be careful: Depending on your destination, it is essential to get out of the station in the right place: at the building with the stop of the same name or at Kalkbreite or on the Seebahnstrasse side. This may save two trams! \ud83d\ude02",

              "text": "We only needed a room for one night before our flight out,and at $300, this seemed like nice accommodations and better priced than others. First the good, The staff was lovely. Very friendly, especially the bartenders at the pool bar where we had a few drinks in the evening. My issues were first, the room. It definitely didn't look like the pictures that were showed online of bright airy rooms. It was extremely small and bare, just a bed, TV and small desk, the floors were black and the walls dark green so it felt like a dungeon. Just dark and depressing. My second issue...we arrived after a long train ride and wanted coffee. During the course of the day we spent about $25 on coffee at the restaurant and bar. It wasn't until before checkout the next morning that I found a room downstairs that had a complimentary coffee machine. Maybe the staff could have mentioned that? Especially when we're sitting in the very next room paying for it??",

We stopped there on Saturday evening for a pre dinner drink, the bar was barely half full, we sat outside and although we had been seen, no one approached us for a good 20 mins. After finally ordering a cocktail and a glass of wine, we waited another 20 mins for it to be served to us, while the bar person was arranging glasses on the bar shelf. Overall, a very poor experience and I doubt we'll be back.",

On arrival at the hotel at 9.30am we were absolutely delighted to find that our room was ready.  The room, though small, was clean and had everything we needed.  Staff were very friendly and helpful, lent us an adaptor plug for our chargers (we have several but none that fitted the Swiss version!).    The hotel is very conveniently located - walking distance from the main station or there is a station (Selnau) within 100m of the hotel.  Great location to catch a tram or to walk into the city.   We would definitely stay here again.",

Very friendly, especially the bartenders at the pool bar where we had a few drinks in the evening. My issues were first, the room. It definitely didn't look like the pictures that were showed online of bright airy rooms. It was extremely small and bare, just a bed, TV and small desk, the floors were black and the walls dark green so it felt like a dungeon. Just dark and depressing. My second issue...we arrived after a long train ride and wanted coffee. During the course of the day we spent about $25 on coffee at the restaurant and bar. It wasn't until before checkout the next morning that I found a room downstairs that had a complimentary coffee machine. Maybe the staff could have mentioned that? Especially when we're sitting in the very next room paying for it??",

Staff were very friendly and helpful, lent us an adaptor plug for our chargers (we have several but none that fitted the Swiss version!).

I'd just recently arrives in Zurich and was looking for GPs that accept new patiens (highly non-trivial), so I ended up at this clinic almost by accident, but I'm glad I did.\n\nDr. Berrah is paying every attention needed: compared the treatments, and offered the one that suited me most (injections over supplements, since I have a tendency for stomack issues), recommended me amazing specialists to get checkups and find a cause or at least exclude the most dangerous potential causes. He recommeded me regular check-ups for iron level to not allow it to drop as low as when it was when I just came. I had in total three visits over a year, two of them resulted in recommendation for iron injectoins, which I also made at the same clinic.\n\nDr. Berrah, all the nurses and reception personnal were kind, friendly, and inviting throughout my visits. I especially appreciated that since I'm new to Switzerland (and it's medical system) and don't speak German",

Within a very short time, she had constructed the perfect plan for me, which included exactly those points that were important to me in advance. So I was introduced to all the exercises perfectly at my own pace, so that I understood them exactly after just a few attempts.\n\nIn addition to the professional, nice but strict manner, all of my questions are answered professionally and I receive exactly the support I need. I can already see progress, which can be attributed to Ms. Bilen's targeted training structure.\n\nI have also found the entire team at HT Health Training AG to be very open-minded, friendly and helpful and I always look forward to going to training.

I tried a session in Studio Forum and I fell in love on how the workout is being done the very first time. I tried the other Studio as well (btw, they are all centrally located) but Studio Forum is my go-to studio. The fact that it is only 15 mins away from where I am working. What really makes this studio special (for me) is it is so quiet not a typical chaos fitness studio because only maximum of 5 participants can do the workout in a session - which kinda a private class feel. In terms of the changing room and shower room. There is a small toilet inside the Studio where you can change but not do the shower. BUT in the opposite room outside the Studio (still same building) there is a big changing room and shower room - boys and girls are separated which the Booster participants are allowed to use. Tip: bring your own lock.",

(Adjuster for seat is missing, seat positioning at an angle making it uncomfortable, stabilising pads for the bike missing meaning they wobble when you ride them etc.) It's frustrating to pay an annual fee and then to not be able to attend many classes due to lack of availability and when you do attend to have to put up with old and/or broken equipment.",

I had booked for 1 hour session. She did not keep track of the time (neither did I) and in the end she found out she did 90 minutes. So she decided that I must pay for 90 minutes which she also charged. I did not argue with her at that moment (which I now regret). As a trainer it is her responsibility to keep track of the time and be disciplined, I am the customer.\n\nI left with a bitter feeling and I cannot recommend.",

The meditations and breathing exercises suggested in the course are also great preparation for the upcoming birth!",

Very friendly, especially the bartenders at the pool bar where we had a few drinks in the evening. My issues were first, the room. It definitely didn't look like the pictures that were showed online of bright airy rooms. It was extremely small and bare, just a bed, TV and small desk, the floors were black and the walls dark green so it felt like a dungeon. Just dark and depressing. My second issue...we arrived after a long train ride and wanted coffee. During the course of the day we spent about $25 on coffee at the restaurant and bar. It wasn't until before checkout the next morning that I found a room downstairs that had a complimentary coffee machine. Maybe the staff could have mentioned that? Especially when we're sitting in the very next room paying for it??",

We stopped there on Saturday evening for a pre dinner drink, the bar was barely half full, we sat outside and although we had been seen, no one approached us for a good 20 mins. After finally ordering a cocktail and a glass of wine, we waited another 20 mins for it to be served to us, while the bar person was arranging glasses on the bar shelf. Overall, a very poor experience and I doubt we'll be back.",

On arrival at the hotel at 9.30am we were absolutely delighted to find that our room was ready.  The room, though small, was clean and had everything we needed.  Staff were very friendly and helpful, lent us an adaptor plug for our chargers (we have several but none that fitted the Swiss version!).    The hotel is very conveniently located - walking distance from the main station or there is a station (Selnau) within 100m of the hotel.  Great location to catch a tram or to walk into the city.   We would definitely stay here again.",

But most of it is aligned to North India and lesser to South India.\nNonetheless, the most important thing is that everything is fresh (atleast for once we don't need to constantly check expiry dates) and staff are very friendly.\nThey have a small food counter as well which has very good Indian food at very reasonable prices. Prices are atleast 25% lesser than Indian restaurants in Switzerland even some having food that is very bad.\n\nHave added some pictures of unique items we found at the store like mixer grinder, cooker, idly maker, etc.\n\nFinally, getting to the store is quite easy even if you are coming from any other city. Get down at Zurich HB and take a quick tram and a 5 mins walk.\n\nHope this helps.",

The taste of Taiwanese and Japanese has been recognised as top, if not the best, of the world. Their texture is also better than, say, Thai or Indian rice, in terms of stickiness and firmness. Definitely the top option if you are to make sushi or onigiri (rice ball).",

Very friendly, especially the bartenders at the pool bar where we had a few drinks in the evening. My issues were first, the room. It definitely didn't look like the pictures that were showed online of bright airy rooms. It was extremely small and bare, just a bed, TV and small desk, the floors were black and the walls dark green so it felt like a dungeon. Just dark and depressing. My second issue...we arrived after a long train ride and wanted coffee. During the course of the day we spent about $25 on coffee at the restaurant and bar. It wasn't until before checkout the next morning that I found a room downstairs that had a complimentary coffee machine. Maybe the staff could have mentioned that? Especially when we're sitting in the very next room paying for it??",

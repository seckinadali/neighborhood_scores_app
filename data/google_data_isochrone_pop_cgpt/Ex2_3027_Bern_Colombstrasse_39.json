Be sure to make a reservation to ensure you get a spot. We had a fantastic meal, trying a variety of dishes. The sweet potato fries were crispy and delicious, the steamed buns were soft and flavorful, and the dumplings were perfectly cooked. The stir-fried noodles were fresh and had a great mix of flavors. The beer complemented the meal perfectly. However, the sushi prices surprised us\u2014they were quite high, so we opted not to try them this time. Highly recommend this place for its excellent service and delicious Asian cuisine. Would definitely come back!",

Our group of ten, all of African descent, visited, with six of us ordering coffee while the other two were waiting for their orders. Despite this, the waitress was consistently hostile and informed us that we couldn't sit there without everyone ordering. Her attitude felt discriminatory and made the entire visit unpleasant. It's disheartening to encounter such treatment, and it's unlikely we'll return. Customer service should be welcoming to everyone, regardless of race or background.",

The staff was very precise and very very kind which I loved and you definitely feel very welcomed when you\u2019re there. Furthermore, the interior of the restaurant is very special and very cozy and artistic, which I loved.\nIf you\u2019re visiting Bern and are thinking of having a tasty meal, Piazza is the place for you!",

              "text": "I recently visited Bernaqua for the sauna and spa experience. Having visited spas across Europe for over two decades, I must say this was by far the worst experience I've had. One positive note is that the facility is spotlessly clean. However, all other aspects were disappointing.\n\nFirstly, the design and materials of the building are very unwelcoming. Hard surfaces reflect all sounds, including children, breathing, walking, and cleaning equipment, which is constantly in use. Even at distances of 20-30 meters, you hear everything. It results in a constant barrage of indistinct sounds that permeate even the saunas. The sleep/silent room is also plagued by the sound of the nearby highway, coupled with ventilation noise, and it is uncomfortably cold. Additionally, it looks like a garage filled with mismatched furniture.\n\nMoreover, the signage is very confusing. Upon entry, you're greeted by a cacophony of screaming children, and due to the poor acoustic design, it is quite painful on the ears. There seems to be a separate spa dressing room, but it's only for members. As a result, you end up walking a significant distance to find an empty dressing room, only to realize you need to wear bathing clothes to access the sauna area. Finding the showers is another challenge, as you must pass two saunas and follow confusing signage. It appears forbidden to use soap in some showers, but later on, you discover another shower area where soap use is presumably allowed.\n\nThe shower water seems full of chlorine. My eyes hurt like when i was diving in school pool with open eyes but no goggles. And the lighting is harsh white LED, directly in your face. The overall aesthetic feels like a mix of Soviet and East German influences, devoid of any understanding of rich Russian or European sauna culture. Despite the use of high-end materials, the design lacks coherence. For example, one sauna features a \u201ccatwalk\u201d that squeaks and is poorly lit, making you feel uncomfortable under the dim white LED light while others stare at you. I normally don't mind being naked in public spaces, but this place made me feel very self-conscious and uncomfortable.\n\nSome vending machines with dry salads and no cutlery to top it off.\n\nI believe some plants, wooden room dividers, and a separate dressing room could significantly improve the atmosphere. It needs a touch of warmth and thoughtful design. As it stands, I left with more stress and less money. And I am not typically a complaining type.\n\nSave your time and money and go somewhere else to recharge. If you really must go I highly recommend you take earplugs and shades/sleep masks with you.",

              "text": "Unsatisfied experience at Mobilezone\n\nI recently had an extremely unsatisfactory experience at Mobilezone. I originally planned to get a mobile phone subscription, but the advice I received left a bitter aftertaste.\n\nThe salesperson suggested changing my internet provider from UPC to Sunrise as my promotion with UPC was expiring. He assured me that this would save me the 54 CHF for the cell phone deposit. He also promised me \u201cfree\u201d headphones and a phone case for half the price. I confidently accepted this offer.\n\nHowever, after I contacted UPC back home, they offered to extend the promotion for another 2 years, which was clearly a better offer than Sunrise's. When I tried to cancel the migration, the salesperson said he would discuss it with his colleague and call me back the next day. That callback never came.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of communication, I went back to the store to ask. The seller's response was simply disappointing: \"Been busy.\" When I tried to cancel the migration again, I was suddenly charged a fee of 150 CHF. I was informed that if I wanted to cancel this fee would be applied to the supposedly \"free\" headphones, phone case and cell phone.\n\nUltimately, I was forced to contact Sunrise directly to cancel the migration, which involved additional time and inconvenience. This experience not only cost me money, but also valuable time and nerves. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of transparency and unfair treatment by Mobilezone.",

              "text": "I recently visited Bernaqua for the sauna and spa experience. Having visited spas across Europe for over two decades, I must say this was by far the worst experience I've had. One positive note is that the facility is spotlessly clean. However, all other aspects were disappointing.\n\nFirstly, the design and materials of the building are very unwelcoming. Hard surfaces reflect all sounds, including children, breathing, walking, and cleaning equipment, which is constantly in use. Even at distances of 20-30 meters, you hear everything. It results in a constant barrage of indistinct sounds that permeate even the saunas. The sleep/silent room is also plagued by the sound of the nearby highway, coupled with ventilation noise, and it is uncomfortably cold. Additionally, it looks like a garage filled with mismatched furniture.\n\nMoreover, the signage is very confusing. Upon entry, you're greeted by a cacophony of screaming children, and due to the poor acoustic design, it is quite painful on the ears. There seems to be a separate spa dressing room, but it's only for members. As a result, you end up walking a significant distance to find an empty dressing room, only to realize you need to wear bathing clothes to access the sauna area. Finding the showers is another challenge, as you must pass two saunas and follow confusing signage. It appears forbidden to use soap in some showers, but later on, you discover another shower area where soap use is presumably allowed.\n\nThe shower water seems full of chlorine. My eyes hurt like when i was diving in school pool with open eyes but no goggles. And the lighting is harsh white LED, directly in your face. The overall aesthetic feels like a mix of Soviet and East German influences, devoid of any understanding of rich Russian or European sauna culture. Despite the use of high-end materials, the design lacks coherence. For example, one sauna features a \u201ccatwalk\u201d that squeaks and is poorly lit, making you feel uncomfortable under the dim white LED light while others stare at you. I normally don't mind being naked in public spaces, but this place made me feel very self-conscious and uncomfortable.\n\nSome vending machines with dry salads and no cutlery to top it off.\n\nI believe some plants, wooden room dividers, and a separate dressing room could significantly improve the atmosphere. It needs a touch of warmth and thoughtful design. As it stands, I left with more stress and less money. And I am not typically a complaining type.\n\nSave your time and money and go somewhere else to recharge. If you really must go I highly recommend you take earplugs and shades/sleep masks with you.",

We went while on vacation in Bern and the kids just needed a nice fun break from sightseeing.\nYes, they sell swimsuits right there for those that didn\u2019t think to pack one on a December trip to Switzerland :)\nOverall highly recommend the place for a fun relaxing non-touristy activity especially for the kids!",

He listens attentively to your needs, asks lots of questions, and finds a suitable solution for you, that will not put a big dent in your wallet. He has saved me lots of money, and kept my car running and passing safety inspections numerous times. I've been to quite a few garages in Bern, and this is by far the best one. Can't recommend it enough.",

              "text": "Unsatisfied experience at Mobilezone\n\nI recently had an extremely unsatisfactory experience at Mobilezone. I originally planned to get a mobile phone subscription, but the advice I received left a bitter aftertaste.\n\nThe salesperson suggested changing my internet provider from UPC to Sunrise as my promotion with UPC was expiring. He assured me that this would save me the 54 CHF for the cell phone deposit. He also promised me \u201cfree\u201d headphones and a phone case for half the price. I confidently accepted this offer.\n\nHowever, after I contacted UPC back home, they offered to extend the promotion for another 2 years, which was clearly a better offer than Sunrise's. When I tried to cancel the migration, the salesperson said he would discuss it with his colleague and call me back the next day. That callback never came.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of communication, I went back to the store to ask. The seller's response was simply disappointing: \"Been busy.\" When I tried to cancel the migration again, I was suddenly charged a fee of 150 CHF. I was informed that if I wanted to cancel this fee would be applied to the supposedly \"free\" headphones, phone case and cell phone.\n\nUltimately, I was forced to contact Sunrise directly to cancel the migration, which involved additional time and inconvenience. This experience not only cost me money, but also valuable time and nerves. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of transparency and unfair treatment by Mobilezone.",

              "text": "I recently visited Bernaqua for the sauna and spa experience. Having visited spas across Europe for over two decades, I must say this was by far the worst experience I've had. One positive note is that the facility is spotlessly clean. However, all other aspects were disappointing.\n\nFirstly, the design and materials of the building are very unwelcoming. Hard surfaces reflect all sounds, including children, breathing, walking, and cleaning equipment, which is constantly in use. Even at distances of 20-30 meters, you hear everything. It results in a constant barrage of indistinct sounds that permeate even the saunas. The sleep/silent room is also plagued by the sound of the nearby highway, coupled with ventilation noise, and it is uncomfortably cold. Additionally, it looks like a garage filled with mismatched furniture.\n\nMoreover, the signage is very confusing. Upon entry, you're greeted by a cacophony of screaming children, and due to the poor acoustic design, it is quite painful on the ears. There seems to be a separate spa dressing room, but it's only for members. As a result, you end up walking a significant distance to find an empty dressing room, only to realize you need to wear bathing clothes to access the sauna area. Finding the showers is another challenge, as you must pass two saunas and follow confusing signage. It appears forbidden to use soap in some showers, but later on, you discover another shower area where soap use is presumably allowed.\n\nThe shower water seems full of chlorine. My eyes hurt like when i was diving in school pool with open eyes but no goggles. And the lighting is harsh white LED, directly in your face. The overall aesthetic feels like a mix of Soviet and East German influences, devoid of any understanding of rich Russian or European sauna culture. Despite the use of high-end materials, the design lacks coherence. For example, one sauna features a \u201ccatwalk\u201d that squeaks and is poorly lit, making you feel uncomfortable under the dim white LED light while others stare at you. I normally don't mind being naked in public spaces, but this place made me feel very self-conscious and uncomfortable.\n\nSome vending machines with dry salads and no cutlery to top it off.\n\nI believe some plants, wooden room dividers, and a separate dressing room could significantly improve the atmosphere. It needs a touch of warmth and thoughtful design. As it stands, I left with more stress and less money. And I am not typically a complaining type.\n\nSave your time and money and go somewhere else to recharge. If you really must go I highly recommend you take earplugs and shades/sleep masks with you.",

He listens attentively to your needs, asks lots of questions, and finds a suitable solution for you, that will not put a big dent in your wallet. He has saved me lots of money, and kept my car running and passing safety inspections numerous times. I've been to quite a few garages in Bern, and this is by far the best one.

              "text": "Unsatisfied experience at Mobilezone\n\nI recently had an extremely unsatisfactory experience at Mobilezone. I originally planned to get a mobile phone subscription, but the advice I received left a bitter aftertaste.\n\nThe salesperson suggested changing my internet provider from UPC to Sunrise as my promotion with UPC was expiring. He assured me that this would save me the 54 CHF for the cell phone deposit. He also promised me \u201cfree\u201d headphones and a phone case for half the price. I confidently accepted this offer.\n\nHowever, after I contacted UPC back home, they offered to extend the promotion for another 2 years, which was clearly a better offer than Sunrise's. When I tried to cancel the migration, the salesperson said he would discuss it with his colleague and call me back the next day. That callback never came.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of communication, I went back to the store to ask. The seller's response was simply disappointing: \"Been busy.\" When I tried to cancel the migration again, I was suddenly charged a fee of 150 CHF. I was informed that if I wanted to cancel this fee would be applied to the supposedly \"free\" headphones, phone case and cell phone.\n\nUltimately, I was forced to contact Sunrise directly to cancel the migration, which involved additional time and inconvenience. This experience not only cost me money, but also valuable time and nerves. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of transparency and unfair treatment by Mobilezone.",

              "text": "I recently visited Bernaqua for the sauna and spa experience. Having visited spas across Europe for over two decades, I must say this was by far the worst experience I've had. One positive note is that the facility is spotlessly clean. However, all other aspects were disappointing.\n\nFirstly, the design and materials of the building are very unwelcoming. Hard surfaces reflect all sounds, including children, breathing, walking, and cleaning equipment, which is constantly in use. Even at distances of 20-30 meters, you hear everything. It results in a constant barrage of indistinct sounds that permeate even the saunas. The sleep/silent room is also plagued by the sound of the nearby highway, coupled with ventilation noise, and it is uncomfortably cold. Additionally, it looks like a garage filled with mismatched furniture.\n\nMoreover, the signage is very confusing. Upon entry, you're greeted by a cacophony of screaming children, and due to the poor acoustic design, it is quite painful on the ears. There seems to be a separate spa dressing room, but it's only for members. As a result, you end up walking a significant distance to find an empty dressing room, only to realize you need to wear bathing clothes to access the sauna area. Finding the showers is another challenge, as you must pass two saunas and follow confusing signage. It appears forbidden to use soap in some showers, but later on, you discover another shower area where soap use is presumably allowed.\n\nThe shower water seems full of chlorine. My eyes hurt like when i was diving in school pool with open eyes but no goggles. And the lighting is harsh white LED, directly in your face. The overall aesthetic feels like a mix of Soviet and East German influences, devoid of any understanding of rich Russian or European sauna culture. Despite the use of high-end materials, the design lacks coherence. For example, one sauna features a \u201ccatwalk\u201d that squeaks and is poorly lit, making you feel uncomfortable under the dim white LED light while others stare at you. I normally don't mind being naked in public spaces, but this place made me feel very self-conscious and uncomfortable.\n\nSome vending machines with dry salads and no cutlery to top it off.\n\nI believe some plants, wooden room dividers, and a separate dressing room could significantly improve the atmosphere. It needs a touch of warmth and thoughtful design. As it stands, I left with more stress and less money. And I am not typically a complaining type.\n\nSave your time and money and go somewhere else to recharge. If you really must go I highly recommend you take earplugs and shades/sleep masks with you.",

Lots of play toys for everyone, including a huge inflated floating island and a massive tube slide that\u2019s 3 stories tall. The place is extremely clean and people are just so nice and courteous. We went while on vacation in Bern and the kids just needed a nice fun break from sightseeing.\nYes, they sell swimsuits right there for those that didn\u2019t think to pack one on a December trip to Switzerland :)\nOverall highly recommend the place for a fun relaxing non-touristy activity especially for the kids!",

I originally planned to get a mobile phone subscription, but the advice I received left a bitter aftertaste.\n\nThe salesperson suggested changing my internet provider from UPC to Sunrise as my promotion with UPC was expiring. He assured me that this would save me the 54 CHF for the cell phone deposit. He also promised me \u201cfree\u201d headphones and a phone case for half the price. I confidently accepted this offer.\n\nHowever, after I contacted UPC back home, they offered to extend the promotion for another 2 years, which was clearly a better offer than Sunrise's. When I tried to cancel the migration, the salesperson said he would discuss it with his colleague and call me back the next day. That callback never came.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of communication, I went back to the store to ask. The seller's response was simply disappointing: \"Been busy.\" When I tried to cancel the migration again, I was suddenly charged a fee of 150 CHF. I was informed that if I wanted to cancel this fee would be applied to the supposedly \"free\" headphones, phone case and cell phone.\n\nUltimately, I was forced to contact Sunrise directly to cancel the migration, which involved additional time and inconvenience. This experience not only cost me money, but also valuable time and nerves. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of transparency and unfair treatment by Mobilezone.",

              "text": "I recently visited Bernaqua for the sauna and spa experience. Having visited spas across Europe for over two decades, I must say this was by far the worst experience I've had. One positive note is that the facility is spotlessly clean. However, all other aspects were disappointing.\n\nFirstly, the design and materials of the building are very unwelcoming. Hard surfaces reflect all sounds, including children, breathing, walking, and cleaning equipment, which is constantly in use. Even at distances of 20-30 meters, you hear everything. It results in a constant barrage of indistinct sounds that permeate even the saunas. The sleep/silent room is also plagued by the sound of the nearby highway, coupled with ventilation noise, and it is uncomfortably cold. Additionally, it looks like a garage filled with mismatched furniture.\n\nMoreover, the signage is very confusing. Upon entry, you're greeted by a cacophony of screaming children, and due to the poor acoustic design, it is quite painful on the ears. There seems to be a separate spa dressing room, but it's only for members. As a result, you end up walking a significant distance to find an empty dressing room, only to realize you need to wear bathing clothes to access the sauna area. Finding the showers is another challenge, as you must pass two saunas and follow confusing signage. It appears forbidden to use soap in some showers, but later on, you discover another shower area where soap use is presumably allowed.\n\nThe shower water seems full of chlorine. My eyes hurt like when i was diving in school pool with open eyes but no goggles. And the lighting is harsh white LED, directly in your face. The overall aesthetic feels like a mix of Soviet and East German influences, devoid of any understanding of rich Russian or European sauna culture. Despite the use of high-end materials, the design lacks coherence. For example, one sauna features a \u201ccatwalk\u201d that squeaks and is poorly lit, making you feel uncomfortable under the dim white LED light while others stare at you. I normally don't mind being naked in public spaces, but this place made me feel very self-conscious and uncomfortable.\n\nSome vending machines with dry salads and no cutlery to top it off.\n\nI believe some plants, wooden room dividers, and a separate dressing room could significantly improve the atmosphere. It needs a touch of warmth and thoughtful design. As it stands, I left with more stress and less money. And I am not typically a complaining type.\n\nSave your time and money and go somewhere else to recharge. If you really must go I highly recommend you take earplugs and shades/sleep masks with you.",

Lots of play toys for everyone, including a huge inflated floating island and a massive tube slide that\u2019s 3 stories tall. The place is extremely clean and people are just so nice and courteous. We went while on vacation in Bern and the kids just needed a nice fun break from sightseeing.\nYes, they sell swimsuits right there for those that didn\u2019t think to pack one on a December trip to Switzerland :)\nOverall highly recommend the place for a fun relaxing non-touristy activity especially for the kids!",

Alpamare has at least twice as many, more outdoor pools, a wave pool etc. so alpamare is a lot more fun than this one. But this one is nice for what it is. Also, when we were there, it felt really full and we had to wait nearly 15min to go down a slide. When we left (attendance was still increasing), the website showed 60% full.

Hard surfaces reflect all sounds, including children, breathing, walking, and cleaning equipment, which is constantly in use. Even at distances of 20-30 meters, you hear everything. It results in a constant barrage of indistinct sounds that permeate even the saunas. The sleep/silent room is also plagued by the sound of the nearby highway, coupled with ventilation noise, and it is uncomfortably cold. Additionally, it looks like a garage filled with mismatched furniture.\n\nMoreover, the signage is very confusing. Upon entry, you're greeted by a cacophony of screaming children, and due to the poor acoustic design, it is quite painful on the ears. There seems to be a separate spa dressing room, but it's only for members. As a result, you end up walking a significant distance to find an empty dressing room, only to realize you need to wear bathing clothes to access the sauna area. Finding the showers is another challenge, as you must pass two saunas and follow confusing signage. It appears forbidden to use soap in some showers, but later on, you discover another shower area where soap use is presumably allowed.\n\nThe shower water seems full of chlorine. My eyes hurt like when i was diving in school pool with open eyes but no goggles. And the lighting is harsh white LED, directly in your face. The overall aesthetic feels like a mix of Soviet and East German influences, devoid of any understanding of rich Russian or European sauna culture. Despite the use of high-end materials, the design lacks coherence. For example, one sauna features a \u201ccatwalk\u201d that squeaks and is poorly lit, making you feel uncomfortable under the dim white LED light while others stare at you. I normally don't mind being naked in public spaces, but this place made me feel very self-conscious and uncomfortable.\n\nSome vending machines with dry salads and no cutlery to top it off.\n\nI believe some plants, wooden room dividers, and a separate dressing room could significantly improve the atmosphere. It needs a touch of warmth and thoughtful design. As it stands, I left with more stress and less money. And I am not typically a complaining type.\n\nSave your time and money and go somewhere else to recharge. If you really must go I highly recommend you take earplugs and shades/sleep masks with you.",

Lots of play toys for everyone, including a huge inflated floating island and a massive tube slide that\u2019s 3 stories tall. The place is extremely clean and people are just so nice and courteous. We went while on vacation in Bern and the kids just needed a nice fun break from sightseeing.\nYes, they sell swimsuits right there for those that didn\u2019t think to pack one on a December trip to Switzerland :)\nOverall highly recommend the place for a fun relaxing non-touristy activity especially for the kids!",

Alpamare has at least twice as many, more outdoor pools, a wave pool etc. so alpamare is a lot more fun than this one. But this one is nice for what it is. Also, when we were there, it felt really full and we had to wait nearly 15min to go down a slide. When we left (attendance was still increasing), the website showed 60% full. But it really felt like 100% full already",

I originally planned to get a mobile phone subscription, but the advice I received left a bitter aftertaste.\n\nThe salesperson suggested changing my internet provider from UPC to Sunrise as my promotion with UPC was expiring. He assured me that this would save me the 54 CHF for the cell phone deposit. He also promised me \u201cfree\u201d headphones and a phone case for half the price. I confidently accepted this offer.\n\nHowever, after I contacted UPC back home, they offered to extend the promotion for another 2 years, which was clearly a better offer than Sunrise's. When I tried to cancel the migration, the salesperson said he would discuss it with his colleague and call me back the next day. That callback never came.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of communication, I went back to the store to ask. The seller's response was simply disappointing: \"Been busy.\" When I tried to cancel the migration again, I was suddenly charged a fee of 150 CHF. I was informed that if I wanted to cancel this fee would be applied to the supposedly \"free\" headphones, phone case and cell phone.\n\nUltimately, I was forced to contact Sunrise directly to cancel the migration, which involved additional time and inconvenience. This experience not only cost me money, but also valuable time and nerves. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of transparency and unfair treatment by Mobilezone.",

              "text": "I recently visited Bernaqua for the sauna and spa experience. Having visited spas across Europe for over two decades, I must say this was by far the worst experience I've had. One positive note is that the facility is spotlessly clean. However, all other aspects were disappointing.\n\nFirstly, the design and materials of the building are very unwelcoming. Hard surfaces reflect all sounds, including children, breathing, walking, and cleaning equipment, which is constantly in use. Even at distances of 20-30 meters, you hear everything. It results in a constant barrage of indistinct sounds that permeate even the saunas. The sleep/silent room is also plagued by the sound of the nearby highway, coupled with ventilation noise, and it is uncomfortably cold. Additionally, it looks like a garage filled with mismatched furniture.\n\nMoreover, the signage is very confusing. Upon entry, you're greeted by a cacophony of screaming children, and due to the poor acoustic design, it is quite painful on the ears. There seems to be a separate spa dressing room, but it's only for members. As a result, you end up walking a significant distance to find an empty dressing room, only to realize you need to wear bathing clothes to access the sauna area. Finding the showers is another challenge, as you must pass two saunas and follow confusing signage. It appears forbidden to use soap in some showers, but later on, you discover another shower area where soap use is presumably allowed.\n\nThe shower water seems full of chlorine. My eyes hurt like when i was diving in school pool with open eyes but no goggles. And the lighting is harsh white LED, directly in your face. The overall aesthetic feels like a mix of Soviet and East German influences, devoid of any understanding of rich Russian or European sauna culture. Despite the use of high-end materials, the design lacks coherence. For example, one sauna features a \u201ccatwalk\u201d that squeaks and is poorly lit, making you feel uncomfortable under the dim white LED light while others stare at you. I normally don't mind being naked in public spaces, but this place made me feel very self-conscious and uncomfortable.\n\nSome vending machines with dry salads and no cutlery to top it off.\n\nI believe some plants, wooden room dividers, and a separate dressing room could significantly improve the atmosphere. It needs a touch of warmth and thoughtful design. As it stands, I left with more stress and less money. And I am not typically a complaining type.\n\nSave your time and money and go somewhere else to recharge. If you really must go I highly recommend you take earplugs and shades/sleep masks with you.",

Lots of play toys for everyone, including a huge inflated floating island and a massive tube slide that\u2019s 3 stories tall. The place is extremely clean and people are just so nice and courteous. We went while on vacation in Bern and the kids just needed a nice fun break from sightseeing.\nYes, they sell swimsuits right there for those that didn\u2019t think to pack one on a December trip to Switzerland :)\nOverall highly recommend the place for a fun relaxing non-touristy activity especially for the kids!",

Alpamare has at least twice as many, more outdoor pools, a wave pool etc. so alpamare is a lot more fun than this one. But this one is nice for what it is. Also, when we were there, it felt really full and we had to wait nearly 15min to go down a slide. When we left (attendance was still increasing), the website showed 60% full. But it really felt like 100% full already",

I originally planned to get a mobile phone subscription, but the advice I received left a bitter aftertaste.\n\nThe salesperson suggested changing my internet provider from UPC to Sunrise as my promotion with UPC was expiring. He assured me that this would save me the 54 CHF for the cell phone deposit. He also promised me \u201cfree\u201d headphones and a phone case for half the price. I confidently accepted this offer.\n\nHowever, after I contacted UPC back home, they offered to extend the promotion for another 2 years, which was clearly a better offer than Sunrise's. When I tried to cancel the migration, the salesperson said he would discuss it with his colleague and call me back the next day. That callback never came.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of communication, I went back to the store to ask. The seller's response was simply disappointing: \"Been busy.\" When I tried to cancel the migration again, I was suddenly charged a fee of 150 CHF. I was informed that if I wanted to cancel this fee would be applied to the supposedly \"free\" headphones, phone case and cell phone.\n\nUltimately, I was forced to contact Sunrise directly to cancel the migration, which involved additional time and inconvenience. This experience not only cost me money, but also valuable time and nerves. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of transparency and unfair treatment by Mobilezone.",

Nice hotel and huge bonus having the train station outside which comes with a pass from the hotel for free travel into Bern and avoid traffic and parking there. Perfect.",

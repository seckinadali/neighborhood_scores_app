From wine being forgotten to be served,  to plates arriving at different times for each diner (even though we each ordered our own tasting menu), it was simply unacceptable.\n\nThe food itself was a letdown, with some dishes overly salty, others served cold, and overall quality failing to meet our expectations.\n\nWhile the views were the sole highlight, the cramped tables left little room for comfort. In fact, our neighboring diners felt closer than our own partner across the table.\n\nSave yourself the disappointment and explore other dining options. Our experience here was regrettable.",

A bar is also there where you can get a drink after (or before) your film.\nDespite these nice sides I was quite disappointed: I saw 2 days ago the trailer, in riffraff, for The zone of interest, which was in German (original), subtitled in french (my mother tongue). Today I went to see it (18:40), and asked at the cashier if there would be subtitles. She assured me that it would be German with German subtitles, which would have been ok for me to understand. But it was sadly in German without subtitles, letting me miss out on all the interesting parts of this specific film: the fact that you understand over the characters chitchat and low talk, how they consider the KL Auschwitz, next to which they live. I had to read the extensively detailed Wikipedia article about the film to fully get it. Had I known that it wouldn\u2019t be subtitled, I would have spared myself the cost of the ticket !",

He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn\u2019t touch his food except for bread.\nSeveral veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list.\nSeveral outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Z\u00fcrich. Inside I could imagine it very busy on weekends. Chill upbeat music, football table.\nBathrooms are downstairs so not easily accessible. Funky graffiti and stickers give it a bit of an underground vibe.\nI would return earlier to try some of the other menu items.",

              "text": "Stepping into Angkor Restaurant in Zurich is like being whisked away to an exotic paradise \ud83c\udf3a. From the moment we entered, the stunning decor captivated us \u2013 a harmonious blend of rich reds, intricate golds, and traditional art that set the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.\n\nThe service? Simply impeccable! Waitstaff dressed in elegant traditional attire greeted us warmly and ensured that every detail was attended to with a professional touch. I particularly appreciated the thoughtful gesture of handling our plates with clean napkins \u2013 a small but significant nod to their commitment to hygiene and fine dining.\n\nNow, onto the feast! We began our culinary journey with the Chicken Satay, which came with a peanut sauce so divine it could have been a meal on its own \ud83e\udd5c. My wife savored her Virgin Mojito, a refreshing concoction that perfectly complemented her N\u00fca Pad Prig Thai Orn (Thai chili beef) \ud83e\udd69\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f. The beef was tender, with just the right amount of spice to make her taste buds dance.\n\nI opted for their signature Angkor Cocktail \ud83c\udf79, a delightful mix that set the tone for my main course \u2013 the N\u00fca Pad Thai. The flavors were a symphony of sweet, sour, and savory, each bite leaving me craving more. What truly elevated the experience were the high risers used for serving \u2013 not only did they add a touch of elegance, but they also kept our dishes warm throughout the meal.\n\nAnd let's talk about those plates! Each one was a work of art, meticulously designed and changing with every course. It was like dining in a palace, where every detail was crafted to perfection. The beautiful ceramic dishes were almost too pretty to eat from \u2013 almost!\n\nIn summary, Angkor Restaurant offers more than just a meal; it\u2019s a luxurious dive into Thai culinary artistry, wrapped in an atmosphere of serene elegance. Whether you\u2019re celebrating a special occasion or simply indulging in a night out, this gem in Zurich promises an exquisite experience that will leave you with a heart full of joy and a belly full of delight. \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\u2728",

I mainly wanted to come for karoake as it is listed on the website, but sadly it does not exist anymore (please update your website!).\n\nThe staff seemed pretty stressed out. I ordered two bottles of champagne for my table and the staff forgot to pour one glass for a guest.\n\nI wanted to order the mixed dim sum for the table and asked how many people does it feed. I guess the staff thought I and others asked how many pieces because they answered \u201cfor four\u201d. As we were ten people I ordered two orders. The staff came back with four plates only and the two baskets of four pieces of tiny dumplings. We had to order another two and an additional appetizer to feed everyone.\n\nAfter we all ordered our food and received it, we did not receive enough plates. The staff seemed angry that we asked more than once for plates because he said I know, as he poured our drinks we ordered after we asked for plates.\n\nWe all ordered dessert and finished it. Afterward the staff came and brought me the same dessert I ordered, and sang happy birthday. I was a bit confused, but also questioning why did you not present me this dessert before me ordering it \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt seems a bit unorganized here as there were a lot of guests and perhaps because we were a table of 10. Food was good but I would not come back here again.",

I didn\u2019t manage to get a booking on a Friday evening so we tried our luck to walk in around 6pm. We were considered lucky to have dinner here as the place was filled around 8pm..!\n\nAmbience- cozy and nice space with some traditional rustic vibes\n\nService- There are three waiters when we were there and all of them were not as attentive and being helpful with menus when we asked them question. Not sure if they don\u2019t understand English at all or doesn\u2019t want to\u2026this affects our dining experience which was a bit disappointing.\n\nFood- we\u2019ve ordered the meat loaf and veal steak. Both were very homely made taste and flavourful which we enjoyed very much. I specially adore their spactzle! I would highly recommend to have it as sides. For starter we had the bone marrow beef soup and beef tartare- the soup was OK, don\u2019t think there\u2019s any wow factor in there but the beef tartare was amazing.\n\nOverall this is the comfort food I had in Zurich and I really enjoyed the food. Hopefully service will improve next time that will makes it perfect :)",

She wasn't even kind in recommending the wine, luckily I decided by myself which wine to order, because she didn't even know the kind of grapes.  Given the situation we didn't even order food, and we only ordered the wine and then left.  I was very curious to try the cuisine of this restaurant, but after being treated in this way, I think I will never try it, even though there are other Santa Lucia restaurants in Zurich.

I was shocked by the price but the burger was very nice (McChicken paprika)  I also noticed that quarter pounders here are called Royale, first time I've seen that since watching Pulp Fiction :)",

You need to receive a confirmation message to be able to use it.\n\nOverall not bad, but not great either. (Also, I don't know if the calorie and WiFi stuff are a national thing, so there's that.)",

He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn\u2019t touch his food except for bread.\nSeveral veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list.\nSeveral outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Z\u00fcrich.

Air conditioner only comes on in the mid-summer and heating is only in the mid-winter, so gets warm until the AC comes on and can't open the windows due to City noises and sirens.

From wine being forgotten to be served,  to plates arriving at different times for each diner (even though we each ordered our own tasting menu), it was simply unacceptable.\n\nThe food itself was a letdown, with some dishes overly salty, others served cold, and overall quality failing to meet our expectations.\n\nWhile the views were the sole highlight, the cramped tables left little room for comfort. In fact, our neighboring diners felt closer than our own partner across the table.\n\nSave yourself the disappointment and explore other dining options. Our experience here was regrettable.",

They seem to become patio nightclubs more than restaurants. A glass was placed at my table, after reading other reviews, it seems water is either self service where the carafes are on the wall, or they want you to order bottled.\nAfterwards, an older man arrived, and didn\u2019t like the table they suggested, and he sat at the other end of mine.  He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn\u2019t touch his food except for bread.\nSeveral veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list.\nSeveral outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Z\u00fcrich. Inside I could imagine it very busy on weekends. Chill upbeat music, football table.\nBathrooms are downstairs so not easily accessible. Funky graffiti and stickers give it a bit of an underground vibe.\nI would return earlier to try some of the other menu items.",

Right next to a tram stop that is a short trip to the historic district and to the train station. Parking is very difficult if you do have your own car, it is underground down a windy tight road, compact cars only I think. Hotel shows some wear and tear but rooms are still quite clean. Air conditioner only comes on in the mid-summer and heating is only in the mid-winter, so gets warm until the AC comes on and can't open the windows due to City noises and sirens.

From wine being forgotten to be served,  to plates arriving at different times for each diner (even though we each ordered our own tasting menu), it was simply unacceptable.\n\nThe food itself was a letdown, with some dishes overly salty, others served cold, and overall quality failing to meet our expectations.\n\nWhile the views were the sole highlight, the cramped tables left little room for comfort. In fact, our neighboring diners felt closer than our own partner across the table.\n\nSave yourself the disappointment and explore other dining options. Our experience here was regrettable.",

They seem to become patio nightclubs more than restaurants. A glass was placed at my table, after reading other reviews, it seems water is either self service where the carafes are on the wall, or they want you to order bottled.\nAfterwards, an older man arrived, and didn\u2019t like the table they suggested, and he sat at the other end of mine.  He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn\u2019t touch his food except for bread.\nSeveral veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list.\nSeveral outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Z\u00fcrich. Inside I could imagine it very busy on weekends. Chill upbeat music, football table.\nBathrooms are downstairs so not easily accessible. Funky graffiti and stickers give it a bit of an underground vibe.\nI would return earlier to try some of the other menu items.",

The location is perfect as it is in the immediate vicinity of the Jumbo shopping center, the MAAG hall, the Hardbr\u00fccke train station and the Abaton cinema. It is also very clean and well maintained. Although it's not quite in the heart of the city, it's an excellent hub from which to explore different parts of the city. The fact that there is a lift connecting the bus station on the bridge and the tram station under the bridge is very convenient. All in all, this is a great place to explore the city and have all amenities close by.",

Right next to a tram stop that is a short trip to the historic district and to the train station. Parking is very difficult if you do have your own car, it is underground down a windy tight road, compact cars only I think. Hotel shows some wear and tear but rooms are still quite clean. Air conditioner only comes on in the mid-summer and heating is only in the mid-winter, so gets warm until the AC comes on and can't open the windows due to City noises and sirens. But a great place to stay while visiting Zurich.  Small rooms but comfortable.",

              "text": "Great pizzas, friendly staff. The kitchen was closed on a Wednesday around 22:00 as many restaurants in the area, pizza cook still tossing dough, though.  They seem to become patio nightclubs more than restaurants. A glass was placed at my table, after reading other reviews, it seems water is either self service where the carafes are on the wall, or they want you to order bottled.\nAfterwards, an older man arrived, and didn\u2019t like the table they suggested, and he sat at the other end of mine.  He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn\u2019t touch his food except for bread.\nSeveral veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list.\nSeveral outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Z\u00fcrich. Inside I could imagine it very busy on weekends. Chill upbeat music, football table.\nBathrooms are downstairs so not easily accessible. Funky graffiti and stickers give it a bit of an underground vibe.\nI would return earlier to try some of the other menu items.",

Other migros fitness, for example in Zug and Luzern have a much better pool area which is actually really warm, and this one in Zurich is way too cold and uncomfortable.

The room cleaning was not good as sweeping and mopping of the rooms was probably done on only 1 day out of the 5 days that we stayed; only the beds were made. The washroom was also not cleaned upto the mark. When we requested for empty plates and cutlery to feed the kids our food during our stay, we were told that they are chargeable. Nowhere, in any country or hotel that we have stayed in have we ever been asked to pay for empty bowls and cutlery. Even warm milk for the kids is generally provided complementary by the hotel which was chargeable here. The play area could have been much better given the ample space.",

He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn\u2019t touch his food except for bread.\nSeveral veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list.\nSeveral outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Z\u00fcrich. Inside I could imagine it very busy on weekends. Chill upbeat music, football table.\nBathrooms are downstairs so not easily accessible. Funky graffiti and stickers give it a bit of an underground vibe.\nI would return earlier to try some of the other menu items.",

Right next to a tram stop that is a short trip to the historic district and to the train station.

Air conditioner only comes on in the mid-summer and heating is only in the mid-winter, so gets warm until the AC comes on and can't open the windows due to City noises and sirens.

He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn\u2019t touch his food except for bread.\nSeveral veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list.\nSeveral outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Z\u00fcrich.

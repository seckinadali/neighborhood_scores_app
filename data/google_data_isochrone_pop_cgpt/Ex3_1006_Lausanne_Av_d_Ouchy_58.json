The grounds and outside of the hotel are beautiful.\n\nThe rooms are a bit small however ours had a nice view of the pool and lake.  There are several areas that could use improvement:  We had to carry our own luggage up the outside stairs.  The room's air conditioner wasn't working so we called the front desk who reviewed the instructions to operate it which we had done correctly. She said someone would be sent up shortly to check. Over an hour later, someone came in only to verify we were correct in how to use the thermostat. We then had to wait 1 1/2 hours for someone else to come repair it. Once repaired it worked however we noticed an on-going noise every 20 seconds when on the High setting.  Adjusting it to the middle setting took care of the sound.\n\nTo end on a good note, the breakfast was wonderful and the serving staff were very helpful and friendly.",

The concierge asked if I wanted it with bacon or not, and I requested it without bacon. An hour later, they brought a plate with a salad that had bacon. The chicken was obviously cooked in the morning, and it was hard, stale, and cold. Overall, the salad was tasteless, even though it's hard to make a bad Caesar salad. The experience at the sky bar was also disappointing. We ordered Ratatouille for chf 35.-, and the dish was just bland. I also want to note that the breakfasts are quite modest.\nIn a European city renowned for its hospitality industry, like Lausanne, it is \u201cno-go\u201d.\nI suspect there are issues with the hotel's kitchen.\nThe indoor swimming room room was dirty, with food scraps under the loungers. You can't help but notice this when swimming in the pool.\nThe staff is numerous, but they forget your requests as soon as they walk away from the table.\nThe hotel room itself was good, the bed was comfortable, the pillows were nice, and the climate control worked. So, if you don't visit the restaurants or eat at the hotel, the impression will be fine.",

It's rare to have an experience where every single encounter stands out, this hotel wrote the book on consistency! The hotel itself is quiet elegance everywhere you look: the lobby, restaurants, rooms, spa, pool! It was soooo comfortable. But the biggest standout were the staff, from our check in experience with Matteo, his greeting (after we had just done a long haul flight from Canada) was perfection, to everyone at the front desk there after, as well as the room attendants, the room service staff were so pleasant upon delivery, as well as the the spa. The biggest standout were the concierge team, they were ALL incredible, we happen to have more encounters with our new friends Giordano and Loris. I have never had concierge service like this!! These guys treated us like we had been good friends for years, offered us very helpful guidance, checked in and asked how our trip was going and actually are a part of our story when we tell family how this trip was. If you are lucky enough to stay at this wonderful hotel, make sure to befriend the concierge staff, they were all above and beyond helpful and memorable!!\n\nOh and make sure to have a dinner at their Sky Lounge, you will not be disappointed and trust the dining choices of the concierge, we were blown away from their other picks as well!",

              "text": "In almost every part of the hotel the street and hotel noise is present. I was in a garden facing room initially, it faces the road and none of the doors are sound proofed. You can hear banging in the other rooms, banging from doors and not sure what else. I felt like my balcony was shaking. The lovely staff tried to accommodate me to another part of the building, also faces a road. There\u2019s another part of the hotel facing a garden but you can still hear all the noise from the other rooms. No views of the lake in any rooms I was offered. But you can clearly see that \u2018lake facing\u2019 rooms face the road anyway (and you\u2019re quite a way from the lake, much closer to the road).\nConsidering how beautiful this area is and the cost of this hotel, I struggle to find value here.\nThere are skiff marks all over the furniture in the rooms, my first room wasn\u2019t clean there were cobwebs on the windows and glass marks and grease marks on the table.\nThe furniture and decor is rather shoddy, dark grey and almost with an air of oppressive sterility, which is misplaced seeing as this is clearly not aiming to be a business hotel.\nReception staff are lovely and helpful, unfortunately I think they must be on commission or some kind of pressure to upsell clients to upgrade their rooms. I\u2019ve been here over 20 times for dinner/drinks/conferences and you always hear them trying to sell upgrades to rooms. And the same was my experience here as a guest.\nWhat a contract to the Savoy in London, which is first rate.",

On the menu there was an option to add truffles to another dish and I asked if I could add it to the salad and they said of course.   And it was so good!   For an entree I had perch, a local favorite.  About 10 filets, lightly breaded and grilled in butter.  It was fantastic.  Dessert was the highlight.   It was an orange souffl\u00e9, but cold and made from an ice cream like texture.  The waitress paired it with a dessert wine and it may be the best dessert I\u2019ve ever tasted.

Also, just walking through this majestic building and absorbing all the art and intricate building details is very plleasing.\n\nAs to the cafe, the service is impeccable by the staff and a pleasure to enjoy.\nAs to the meals, we have a mixed opinion. As we are vegetarians, we contacted the restaurant in advance, and we agreed on two types of salads as starter and either tortellini or gnocci as main dishes.\n\nThe food was wel presented as can be seen from the photos. However, the salad with the orange pieces was quite bitter and not to my taste. With a table partner, we swapped the salads, and luckily, the green salad with parmigiano was well seasoned and tasted delicious.\n\nI had the tortellini dish, and while the cheese tortellini was good, the combination with a bitter vegetable and a lot of lemon sauce overpowered the tortellini totally. It was not really enjoyable.\n\nOn the other hand, the persons who had taken the gnocci were very complementary and happy with their dish.",

The room had an incredible view and was very quiet which made us feel so relaxed, exactly what we needed. Finally the hotel is perfectly located by the lake and close to the tube to reach the city center, it was very easy to move around and discover Lausanne. We would definitely come back and recommend it!",

              "text": "During my recent stay at the M\u00f6venpick Hotel Lausanne, I found it to be a generally delightful experience, with a few small areas that could use improvement.\n\nThe location is absolutely stunning, offering breathtaking views of Lake Geneva and the surrounding mountains. It's also conveniently located, making it easy to explore the beautiful city of Lausanne.\n\nThe staff were consistently courteous and helpful, making check-in and check-out processes smooth and ensuring that any questions or needs were promptly addressed. Their dedication to providing excellent customer service was very much appreciated.\n\nThe room, while not particularly spacious, was convenient and perfect for a short stay. It was well-equipped with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable experience. However, I did notice that while the general cleanliness was satisfactory, it was not spotless. There were minor details, such as dust in less obvious areas and some bathroom fixtures that could have been cleaner.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were impressive, with a good variety of delicious dishes available. The dining area itself was spacious and comfortable. However, there was one notable issue at the live cooking station during breakfast. Unfortunately, the chef on duty was not pleasant or friendly and was, in fact, quite rude to a 15-year-old guest. This incident was disappointing and contrasted with the otherwise positive atmosphere of the hotel.\n\nOverall, the M\u00f6venpick Hotel Lausanne is a lovely place to stay, offering comfort and a prime location. With a bit more attention to cleanliness and some improvements in staff training, particularly for the live station chef, it could elevate the guest experience even further. I would certainly consider staying here again in the future.",

              "text": "The hotel is overall a very clean and the staff are friendly. That helps quite a lot. However the room comfort was not up to standard quality. It was below quality in my opinion. The air conditioning unit barely was blowing any form of air. You can sense something is coming out of the vents, however it's so slight that you really can't feel it overall in the room. I went to open the window to have some ventilation and air, however there were a lot of mosquitos every where. I requested a fan of which I received and I'm honestly thankful they did have it (I was considering buying one). So, I used the fan every night before I went to sleep to get some circulation of air into the room, so that solved the problem to an extent. As for the bathroom experience, it was overall fine and clean. However I had to deal extreme cold and hot temperatures at the same time. The water temperature kept fluctuating from extreme to extreme. After a while, I managed to find a pattern and stuck with it. Furthermore, the water pressure was very low, which meant I had to stay in the shower a bit longer than usual. The bed was very comfortable. I accepted that in the end, considering the rate I was paying was quite low, I accepted all the faults that I experienced. I didn't complain to the hotel. I didn't want to make a big issue out of it. I just was glad the checkout day came and that experience won't continue. If there's any recommendation I would give to the hotel, it would be to please stay in such rooms for a week and see how you feel in the end of it. Then, at least you will know which areas to improve.",

Rooms on the first/second floor (the floor above ground level, it depends where you're from) have access to a much larger terrace which was a welcome surprise.\n\nThe elevator is quite small, but it's a historic building so it was expected.\n\nStaff are very polite and were keen to offer directions or recommendations, and readily provided free transit passes for tourists from the city.\nThe location is great as it's just a few minutes from a metro stop, which makes the rest of the city very accessible as well, thanks to Lausanne's excellent public transit system.\n\nOverall, an excellent hotel to spend a romantic escape for two, in one of Europe's finest cities.",

It's also conveniently located, making it easy to explore the beautiful city of Lausanne.\n\nThe staff were consistently courteous and helpful, making check-in and check-out processes smooth and ensuring that any questions or needs were promptly addressed. Their dedication to providing excellent customer service was very much appreciated.\n\nThe room, while not particularly spacious, was convenient and perfect for a short stay. It was well-equipped with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable experience. However, I did notice that while the general cleanliness was satisfactory, it was not spotless. There were minor details, such as dust in less obvious areas and some bathroom fixtures that could have been cleaner.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were impressive, with a good variety of delicious dishes available. The dining area itself was spacious and comfortable. However, there was one notable issue at the live cooking station during breakfast. Unfortunately, the chef on duty was not pleasant or friendly and was, in fact, quite rude to a 15-year-old guest. This incident was disappointing and contrasted with the otherwise positive atmosphere of the hotel.\n\nOverall, the M\u00f6venpick Hotel Lausanne is a lovely place to stay, offering comfort and a prime location. With a bit more attention to cleanliness and some improvements in staff training, particularly for the live station chef, it could elevate the guest experience even further. I would certainly consider staying here again in the future.",

It was below quality in my opinion. The air conditioning unit barely was blowing any form of air. You can sense something is coming out of the vents, however it's so slight that you really can't feel it overall in the room. I went to open the window to have some ventilation and air, however there were a lot of mosquitos every where. I requested a fan of which I received and I'm honestly thankful they did have it (I was considering buying one). So, I used the fan every night before I went to sleep to get some circulation of air into the room, so that solved the problem to an extent. As for the bathroom experience, it was overall fine and clean. However I had to deal extreme cold and hot temperatures at the same time. The water temperature kept fluctuating from extreme to extreme. After a while, I managed to find a pattern and stuck with it. Furthermore, the water pressure was very low, which meant I had to stay in the shower a bit longer than usual. The bed was very comfortable. I accepted that in the end, considering the rate I was paying was quite low, I accepted all the faults that I experienced. I didn't complain to the hotel. I didn't want to make a big issue out of it. I just was glad the checkout day came and that experience won't continue. If there's any recommendation I would give to the hotel, it would be to please stay in such rooms for a week and see how you feel in the end of it. Then, at least you will know which areas to improve.",

But I woke up with one on my face and 2 in the bed. In the morning reception made a note and said to be informing housekeeping. When I arrive back to the room in teh afternoon, this time there was a large group of ants in my room & bathroom. My room was changed. I am sure housekeeping & reception did their best but it was not impossible that housekeeping did not notice them.\n\nthe room I was moved was not maintained in the same level as others. The light in the bathroom was not working.\n\nI also eat dinner in the hotel restaurant for the first time. The service was incredibly slow and it took quite an effort to attract attention from the waiters.\n\nGiven the price/value level, one do not expect these.",

It is unfortunate the hotel has in charge at the breakfast bar on 2nd June 11am such a dismissive and rude employee to customers trying to order a cup of hot chocolate and coffee.  Instead of acknowledging she has received the order, she says she is coming and proceeds to take her time to chat with the other customers after serving them their coffee, after a while we approached her and she responded by giving us a dirty look and still said she\u2019s coming, as if we are bothering her chatting away.  It was clear her behavior towards us was with ill intent else she would not have been eventually arguing and aggressively reacting to us leaving.  Her demeanor is not coherent to the rest of the hotel staff whatsoever, unfortunately it has made our stay less pleasant than we were enjoying.",

There are several areas that could use improvement:  We had to carry our own luggage up the outside stairs.  The room's air conditioner wasn't working so we called the front desk who reviewed the instructions to operate it which we had done correctly. She said someone would be sent up shortly to check. Over an hour later, someone came in only to verify we were correct in how to use the thermostat. We then had to wait 1 1/2 hours for someone else to come repair it. Once repaired it worked however we noticed an on-going noise every 20 seconds when on the High setting.  Adjusting it to the middle setting took care of the sound.\n\nTo end on a good note, the breakfast was wonderful and the serving staff were very helpful and friendly.",

Everything was clearly explained. From the reception to the medical staff and ending with the janitor, the attitude is of genuine care and excellence in what they do. The building is close to the centre of Lausanne, with some views showing the mountains. It is a private hospital, but it feels like a cosy well-managed 5-star hotel from the reception to the rooms and food preparation.\nThank you for your service and care!\nI won't say that I would like to return, but If I need to, I will =).",

It's also conveniently located, making it easy to explore the beautiful city of Lausanne.\n\nThe staff were consistently courteous and helpful, making check-in and check-out processes smooth and ensuring that any questions or needs were promptly addressed. Their dedication to providing excellent customer service was very much appreciated.\n\nThe room, while not particularly spacious, was convenient and perfect for a short stay. It was well-equipped with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable experience. However, I did notice that while the general cleanliness was satisfactory, it was not spotless. There were minor details, such as dust in less obvious areas and some bathroom fixtures that could have been cleaner.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were impressive, with a good variety of delicious dishes available. The dining area itself was spacious and comfortable. However, there was one notable issue at the live cooking station during breakfast. Unfortunately, the chef on duty was not pleasant or friendly and was, in fact, quite rude to a 15-year-old guest. This incident was disappointing and contrasted with the otherwise positive atmosphere of the hotel.\n\nOverall, the M\u00f6venpick Hotel Lausanne is a lovely place to stay, offering comfort and a prime location. With a bit more attention to cleanliness and some improvements in staff training, particularly for the live station chef, it could elevate the guest experience even further. I would certainly consider staying here again in the future.",

              "text": "The hotel is overall a very clean and the staff are friendly. That helps quite a lot. However the room comfort was not up to standard quality. It was below quality in my opinion. The air conditioning unit barely was blowing any form of air. You can sense something is coming out of the vents, however it's so slight that you really can't feel it overall in the room. I went to open the window to have some ventilation and air, however there were a lot of mosquitos every where. I requested a fan of which I received and I'm honestly thankful they did have it (I was considering buying one). So, I used the fan every night before I went to sleep to get some circulation of air into the room, so that solved the problem to an extent. As for the bathroom experience, it was overall fine and clean. However I had to deal extreme cold and hot temperatures at the same time. The water temperature kept fluctuating from extreme to extreme. After a while, I managed to find a pattern and stuck with it. Furthermore, the water pressure was very low, which meant I had to stay in the shower a bit longer than usual. The bed was very comfortable. I accepted that in the end, considering the rate I was paying was quite low, I accepted all the faults that I experienced. I didn't complain to the hotel. I didn't want to make a big issue out of it. I just was glad the checkout day came and that experience won't continue. If there's any recommendation I would give to the hotel, it would be to please stay in such rooms for a week and see how you feel in the end of it. Then, at least you will know which areas to improve.",

There are several areas that could use improvement:  We had to carry our own luggage up the outside stairs.  The room's air conditioner wasn't working so we called the front desk who reviewed the instructions to operate it which we had done correctly. She said someone would be sent up shortly to check. Over an hour later, someone came in only to verify we were correct in how to use the thermostat. We then had to wait 1 1/2 hours for someone else to come repair it. Once repaired it worked however we noticed an on-going noise every 20 seconds when on the High setting.  Adjusting it to the middle setting took care of the sound.\n\nTo end on a good note, the breakfast was wonderful and the serving staff were very helpful and friendly.",

              "text": "I definitely recommend this medical centre.\nThe staff is caring, kind and well prepared.\nI underwent leg surgery and stayed for two nights. The installations are modern and well maintained. Starting with the arrival passing by the intervention to the medical discharge, the details are well thought out for the patients and their visits. Everything was clearly explained. From the reception to the medical staff and ending with the janitor, the attitude is of genuine care and excellence in what they do. The building is close to the centre of Lausanne, with some views showing the mountains. It is a private hospital, but it feels like a cosy well-managed 5-star hotel from the reception to the rooms and food preparation.\nThank you for your service and care!\nI won't say that I would like to return, but If I need to, I will =).",

              "text": "During my recent stay at the M\u00f6venpick Hotel Lausanne, I found it to be a generally delightful experience, with a few small areas that could use improvement.\n\nThe location is absolutely stunning, offering breathtaking views of Lake Geneva and the surrounding mountains. It's also conveniently located, making it easy to explore the beautiful city of Lausanne.\n\nThe staff were consistently courteous and helpful, making check-in and check-out processes smooth and ensuring that any questions or needs were promptly addressed. Their dedication to providing excellent customer service was very much appreciated.\n\nThe room, while not particularly spacious, was convenient and perfect for a short stay. It was well-equipped with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable experience. However, I did notice that while the general cleanliness was satisfactory, it was not spotless. There were minor details, such as dust in less obvious areas and some bathroom fixtures that could have been cleaner.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were impressive, with a good variety of delicious dishes available. The dining area itself was spacious and comfortable. However, there was one notable issue at the live cooking station during breakfast. Unfortunately, the chef on duty was not pleasant or friendly and was, in fact, quite rude to a 15-year-old guest. This incident was disappointing and contrasted with the otherwise positive atmosphere of the hotel.\n\nOverall, the M\u00f6venpick Hotel Lausanne is a lovely place to stay, offering comfort and a prime location. With a bit more attention to cleanliness and some improvements in staff training, particularly for the live station chef, it could elevate the guest experience even further. I would certainly consider staying here again in the future.",

              "text": "The hotel is overall a very clean and the staff are friendly. That helps quite a lot. However the room comfort was not up to standard quality. It was below quality in my opinion. The air conditioning unit barely was blowing any form of air. You can sense something is coming out of the vents, however it's so slight that you really can't feel it overall in the room. I went to open the window to have some ventilation and air, however there were a lot of mosquitos every where. I requested a fan of which I received and I'm honestly thankful they did have it (I was considering buying one). So, I used the fan every night before I went to sleep to get some circulation of air into the room, so that solved the problem to an extent. As for the bathroom experience, it was overall fine and clean. However I had to deal extreme cold and hot temperatures at the same time. The water temperature kept fluctuating from extreme to extreme. After a while, I managed to find a pattern and stuck with it. Furthermore, the water pressure was very low, which meant I had to stay in the shower a bit longer than usual. The bed was very comfortable. I accepted that in the end, considering the rate I was paying was quite low, I accepted all the faults that I experienced. I didn't complain to the hotel. I didn't want to make a big issue out of it. I just was glad the checkout day came and that experience won't continue. If there's any recommendation I would give to the hotel, it would be to please stay in such rooms for a week and see how you feel in the end of it. Then, at least you will know which areas to improve.",

You have wasted paper sending me a brochure I do not want or need and you sent it by UPS - marked Extremely Urgent which I imagine means airfreight. The irony is that the brochure heading is 'Sustainability Transformation' - I think you may need to look at your marketing strategy if you want to attract people who are committed to a Sustainability Transformation. Please remove me from your distribution list - that will at least save some paper and reduce some carbon emissions.  Thanks, Charlotte Fenton",

It's also conveniently located, making it easy to explore the beautiful city of Lausanne.\n\nThe staff were consistently courteous and helpful, making check-in and check-out processes smooth and ensuring that any questions or needs were promptly addressed. Their dedication to providing excellent customer service was very much appreciated.\n\nThe room, while not particularly spacious, was convenient and perfect for a short stay. It was well-equipped with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable experience. However, I did notice that while the general cleanliness was satisfactory, it was not spotless. There were minor details, such as dust in less obvious areas and some bathroom fixtures that could have been cleaner.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were impressive, with a good variety of delicious dishes available. The dining area itself was spacious and comfortable. However, there was one notable issue at the live cooking station during breakfast. Unfortunately, the chef on duty was not pleasant or friendly and was, in fact, quite rude to a 15-year-old guest. This incident was disappointing and contrasted with the otherwise positive atmosphere of the hotel.\n\nOverall, the M\u00f6venpick Hotel Lausanne is a lovely place to stay, offering comfort and a prime location. With a bit more attention to cleanliness and some improvements in staff training, particularly for the live station chef, it could elevate the guest experience even further. I would certainly consider staying here again in the future.",

              "text": "The hotel is overall a very clean and the staff are friendly. That helps quite a lot. However the room comfort was not up to standard quality. It was below quality in my opinion. The air conditioning unit barely was blowing any form of air. You can sense something is coming out of the vents, however it's so slight that you really can't feel it overall in the room. I went to open the window to have some ventilation and air, however there were a lot of mosquitos every where. I requested a fan of which I received and I'm honestly thankful they did have it (I was considering buying one). So, I used the fan every night before I went to sleep to get some circulation of air into the room, so that solved the problem to an extent. As for the bathroom experience, it was overall fine and clean. However I had to deal extreme cold and hot temperatures at the same time. The water temperature kept fluctuating from extreme to extreme. After a while, I managed to find a pattern and stuck with it. Furthermore, the water pressure was very low, which meant I had to stay in the shower a bit longer than usual. The bed was very comfortable. I accepted that in the end, considering the rate I was paying was quite low, I accepted all the faults that I experienced. I didn't complain to the hotel. I didn't want to make a big issue out of it. I just was glad the checkout day came and that experience won't continue. If there's any recommendation I would give to the hotel, it would be to please stay in such rooms for a week and see how you feel in the end of it. Then, at least you will know which areas to improve.",

It is unfortunate the hotel has in charge at the breakfast bar on 2nd June 11am such a dismissive and rude employee to customers trying to order a cup of hot chocolate and coffee.  Instead of acknowledging she has received the order, she says she is coming and proceeds to take her time to chat with the other customers after serving them their coffee, after a while we approached her and she responded by giving us a dirty look and still said she\u2019s coming, as if we are bothering her chatting away.  It was clear her behavior towards us was with ill intent else she would not have been eventually arguing and aggressively reacting to us leaving.  Her demeanor is not coherent to the rest of the hotel staff whatsoever, unfortunately it has made our stay less pleasant than we were enjoying.",

The room's air conditioner wasn't working so we called the front desk who reviewed the instructions to operate it which we had done correctly. She said someone would be sent up shortly to check. Over an hour later, someone came in only to verify we were correct in how to use the thermostat. We then had to wait 1 1/2 hours for someone else to come repair it. Once repaired it worked however we noticed an on-going noise every 20 seconds when on the High setting.  Adjusting it to the middle setting took care of the sound.\n\nTo end on a good note, the breakfast was wonderful and the serving staff were very helpful and friendly.",

The installations are modern and well maintained. Starting with the arrival passing by the intervention to the medical discharge, the details are well thought out for the patients and their visits. Everything was clearly explained. From the reception to the medical staff and ending with the janitor, the attitude is of genuine care and excellence in what they do. The building is close to the centre of Lausanne, with some views showing the mountains. It is a private hospital, but it feels like a cosy well-managed 5-star hotel from the reception to the rooms and food preparation.\nThank you for your service and care!\nI won't say that I would like to return, but If I need to, I will =).",

It's also conveniently located, making it easy to explore the beautiful city of Lausanne.\n\nThe staff were consistently courteous and helpful, making check-in and check-out processes smooth and ensuring that any questions or needs were promptly addressed. Their dedication to providing excellent customer service was very much appreciated.\n\nThe room, while not particularly spacious, was convenient and perfect for a short stay. It was well-equipped with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable experience. However, I did notice that while the general cleanliness was satisfactory, it was not spotless. There were minor details, such as dust in less obvious areas and some bathroom fixtures that could have been cleaner.\n\nThe hotel's dining options were impressive, with a good variety of delicious dishes available. The dining area itself was spacious and comfortable. However, there was one notable issue at the live cooking station during breakfast. Unfortunately, the chef on duty was not pleasant or friendly and was, in fact, quite rude to a 15-year-old guest. This incident was disappointing and contrasted with the otherwise positive atmosphere of the hotel.\n\nOverall, the M\u00f6venpick Hotel Lausanne is a lovely place to stay, offering comfort and a prime location. With a bit more attention to cleanliness and some improvements in staff training, particularly for the live station chef, it could elevate the guest experience even further. I would certainly consider staying here again in the future.",

              "text": "The hotel is overall a very clean and the staff are friendly. That helps quite a lot. However the room comfort was not up to standard quality. It was below quality in my opinion. The air conditioning unit barely was blowing any form of air. You can sense something is coming out of the vents, however it's so slight that you really can't feel it overall in the room. I went to open the window to have some ventilation and air, however there were a lot of mosquitos every where. I requested a fan of which I received and I'm honestly thankful they did have it (I was considering buying one). So, I used the fan every night before I went to sleep to get some circulation of air into the room, so that solved the problem to an extent. As for the bathroom experience, it was overall fine and clean. However I had to deal extreme cold and hot temperatures at the same time. The water temperature kept fluctuating from extreme to extreme. After a while, I managed to find a pattern and stuck with it. Furthermore, the water pressure was very low, which meant I had to stay in the shower a bit longer than usual. The bed was very comfortable. I accepted that in the end, considering the rate I was paying was quite low, I accepted all the faults that I experienced. I didn't complain to the hotel. I didn't want to make a big issue out of it. I just was glad the checkout day came and that experience won't continue. If there's any recommendation I would give to the hotel, it would be to please stay in such rooms for a week and see how you feel in the end of it. Then, at least you will know which areas to improve.",

Rooms on the first/second floor (the floor above ground level, it depends where you're from) have access to a much larger terrace which was a welcome surprise.\n\nThe elevator is quite small, but it's a historic building so it was expected.\n\nStaff are very polite and were keen to offer directions or recommendations, and readily provided free transit passes for tourists from the city.\nThe location is great as it's just a few minutes from a metro stop, which makes the rest of the city very accessible as well, thanks to Lausanne's excellent public transit system.\n\nOverall, an excellent hotel to spend a romantic escape for two, in one of Europe's finest cities.",

There were many complementary things: bruschetta as appetizer, glass of prosecco, a bowl of tangerines after dinner and a limoncello! The interior looks fantastic, like a real museum. Downsides: the chef can be quite expressive and talkative which might disturb some people, service can be slow, the space is narrow and the oil from the grill drizzles around (can stain your clothes, chairs around and the floor), so one has to be careful. Anyway, we enjoyed this place, the atmosphere was as if you\u2019re at somebody\u2019s place in Italy (not perfect, but emotional and fun).",

I haven\u2019t seen any restaurant doing such things for their guest.\u2764\ufe0f\n\nService: service was also quick and nice, cannot comment with a full house as when we went there we were the only ones. \ud83e\udd17\n\nAmbiance: It\u2019s something that I didn\u2019t enjoy. The place is small and the interior is filled with vintage decor, not just the floor but the walls were packed with big frames etc. being an interior appreciator myself I cannot stand such chaos and start feeling claustrophobic and I am not that in personal life.\nSo we decided to sit outside which was much better.\nCutlery was dirty but I think that was real silver and it tends to get dirty if not cleaned in a certain way. But still didn\u2019t felt good in eating with those.\n\nIf you\u2019re a person who likes Vintage and cluttered (closely packed) spaces then you\u2019ll enjoy it.",

Automated check-in can be confusing for the first time.  They provide cleaning once a week but sometimes the cleaning ladies show up late or in different days.\n\nThe location (in Weststrasse) is top.  Many bars and great restaurants nearby.\n\nI would strongly suggest to stay here if you are planning to stay longer and didn\u2019t expect hotel/Airbnb like service.",

It took the \"office\" several weeks to answer and they sent a price together with a link that said \"Accept offer\". The link didn't work, whence I wrote back to get the beds confirmed or to get a new link. After several more weeks we received a mail completely similar to the first one that didn't work and responded the link didn't work, but we would like to confirm that we needed beds for the children.\nWhen we arrived there were no such beds, we then called the office who tolds ud, that the would bring the beds within 30 minutes. They didn't arrive, nor did they let us know, that they couldn't make it.\n\nThe appartement was completey under-equipped when it comes to cutlery and furniture. It was disgustingly dirty with matts of dust on many panels, garbage under the madresses and a nasty, smelly bathroom drain. The washing machine was completely broken and couldn't do any programmes. It only had (very bright) ceiling lights i.e no small / night lamps.\n\nThe \"office\" is close to impossible to reach and you will only find one person in the entire company who knows english. When actually reaching this person, he will let you know that \"You can call any time, we will be ready to meet your requirements\", but then ignore every following call you make during weekdays on all the numbers, that they use.\n\nHere is a non exhaustive list of things that were not satisfactory about our stay:\n1) Close to none customers service\n2) Dishonest employees, with only one english speaking person (who is almost impossible to reach)\n3) Filthy apartment, indluding dusty panels and closets, stained chairs, garbage under madresses, smelly bath drain\n4) Check in at the front door using the screen was not possible\n5) Multiple radiators were turned on with no thermostat mounted, whence heating and impossible to turn off.\n6) Broken toilet seat\n7) Tons of cutlery missing, including knifes, forks, plates, cutting boards, bowl, chefs knife, frying pan, oven gloves, etc\n8) Tons of missing furniture including chairs with back support, night lamps, a regularly sized table\n9) Broken washing machine\n10) Broken window screen\n\nWhen we made the firm aware of these missing / broken things they got to the appartment only bringing a toy sized frying pan with room for 1 egg, mounted only one thermostat, and brought a bowl for salad. They rudely declined the price reduction proposal that we made.\n\nI advise all travellers and people on business trips to STAY AWAY form Living Downtown.",

It took the \"office\" several weeks to answer and they sent a price together with a link that said \"Accept offer\". The link didn't work, whence I wrote back to get the beds confirmed or to get a new link. After several more weeks we received a mail completely similar to the first one that didn't work and responded the link didn't work, but we would like to confirm that we needed beds for the children.\nWhen we arrived there were no such beds, we then called the office who tolds ud, that the would bring the beds within 30 minutes. They didn't arrive, nor did they let us know, that they couldn't make it.\n\nThe appartement was completey under-equipped when it comes to cutlery and furniture. It was disgustingly dirty with matts of dust on many panels, garbage under the madresses and a nasty, smelly bathroom drain. The washing machine was completely broken and couldn't do any programmes. It only had (very bright) ceiling lights i.e no small / night lamps.\n\nThe \"office\" is close to impossible to reach and you will only find one person in the entire company who knows english. When actually reaching this person, he will let you know that \"You can call any time, we will be ready to meet your requirements\", but then ignore every following call you make during weekdays on all the numbers, that they use.\n\nHere is a non exhaustive list of things that were not satisfactory about our stay:\n1) Close to none customers service\n2) Dishonest employees, with only one english speaking person (who is almost impossible to reach)\n3) Filthy apartment, indluding dusty panels and closets, stained chairs, garbage under madresses, smelly bath drain\n4) Check in at the front door using the screen was not possible\n5) Multiple radiators were turned on with no thermostat mounted, whence heating and impossible to turn off.\n6) Broken toilet seat\n7) Tons of cutlery missing, including knifes, forks, plates, cutting boards, bowl, chefs knife, frying pan, oven gloves, etc\n8) Tons of missing furniture including chairs with back support, night lamps, a regularly sized table\n9) Broken washing machine\n10) Broken window screen\n\nWhen we made the firm aware of these missing / broken things they got to the appartment only bringing a toy sized frying pan with room for 1 egg, mounted only one thermostat, and brought a bowl for salad. They rudely declined the price reduction proposal that we made.\n\nI advise all travellers and people on business trips to STAY AWAY form Living Downtown.",

But if you want to travel again, you should change trains in Wiedikon. But be careful: Depending on your destination, it is essential to get out of the station in the right place: at the building with the stop of the same name or at Kalkbreite or on the Seebahnstrasse side.

It took the \"office\" several weeks to answer and they sent a price together with a link that said \"Accept offer\". The link didn't work, whence I wrote back to get the beds confirmed or to get a new link. After several more weeks we received a mail completely similar to the first one that didn't work and responded the link didn't work, but we would like to confirm that we needed beds for the children.\nWhen we arrived there were no such beds, we then called the office who tolds ud, that the would bring the beds within 30 minutes. They didn't arrive, nor did they let us know, that they couldn't make it.\n\nThe appartement was completey under-equipped when it comes to cutlery and furniture. It was disgustingly dirty with matts of dust on many panels, garbage under the madresses and a nasty, smelly bathroom drain. The washing machine was completely broken and couldn't do any programmes. It only had (very bright) ceiling lights i.e no small / night lamps.\n\nThe \"office\" is close to impossible to reach and you will only find one person in the entire company who knows english. When actually reaching this person, he will let you know that \"You can call any time, we will be ready to meet your requirements\", but then ignore every following call you make during weekdays on all the numbers, that they use.\n\nHere is a non exhaustive list of things that were not satisfactory about our stay:\n1) Close to none customers service\n2) Dishonest employees, with only one english speaking person (who is almost impossible to reach)\n3) Filthy apartment, indluding dusty panels and closets, stained chairs, garbage under madresses, smelly bath drain\n4) Check in at the front door using the screen was not possible\n5) Multiple radiators were turned on with no thermostat mounted, whence heating and impossible to turn off.\n6) Broken toilet seat\n7) Tons of cutlery missing, including knifes, forks, plates, cutting boards, bowl, chefs knife, frying pan, oven gloves, etc\n8) Tons of missing furniture including chairs with back support, night lamps, a regularly sized table\n9) Broken washing machine\n10) Broken window screen\n\nWhen we made the firm aware of these missing / broken things they got to the appartment only bringing a toy sized frying pan with room for 1 egg, mounted only one thermostat, and brought a bowl for salad. They rudely declined the price reduction proposal that we made.\n\nI advise all travellers and people on business trips to STAY AWAY form Living Downtown.",

But if you want to travel again, you should change trains in Wiedikon. But be careful: Depending on your destination, it is essential to get out of the station in the right place: at the building with the stop of the same name or at Kalkbreite or on the Seebahnstrasse side. This may save two trams! \ud83d\ude02",

              "text": "The stay at Living Downtown, Weststrase 146, is probably the worst stay I've ever experienced in my entire life.\n\nMy family and I need two children beds for our stay, which I requested 2,5 months before arrival. It took the \"office\" several weeks to answer and they sent a price together with a link that said \"Accept offer\". The link didn't work, whence I wrote back to get the beds confirmed or to get a new link. After several more weeks we received a mail completely similar to the first one that didn't work and responded the link didn't work, but we would like to confirm that we needed beds for the children.\nWhen we arrived there were no such beds, we then called the office who tolds ud, that the would bring the beds within 30 minutes. They didn't arrive, nor did they let us know, that they couldn't make it.\n\nThe appartement was completey under-equipped when it comes to cutlery and furniture. It was disgustingly dirty with matts of dust on many panels, garbage under the madresses and a nasty, smelly bathroom drain. The washing machine was completely broken and couldn't do any programmes. It only had (very bright) ceiling lights i.e no small / night lamps.\n\nThe \"office\" is close to impossible to reach and you will only find one person in the entire company who knows english. When actually reaching this person, he will let you know that \"You can call any time, we will be ready to meet your requirements\", but then ignore every following call you make during weekdays on all the numbers, that they use.\n\nHere is a non exhaustive list of things that were not satisfactory about our stay:\n1) Close to none customers service\n2) Dishonest employees, with only one english speaking person (who is almost impossible to reach)\n3) Filthy apartment, indluding dusty panels and closets, stained chairs, garbage under madresses, smelly bath drain\n4) Check in at the front door using the screen was not possible\n5) Multiple radiators were turned on with no thermostat mounted, whence heating and impossible to turn off.\n6) Broken toilet seat\n7) Tons of cutlery missing, including knifes, forks, plates, cutting boards, bowl, chefs knife, frying pan, oven gloves, etc\n8) Tons of missing furniture including chairs with back support, night lamps, a regularly sized table\n9) Broken washing machine\n10) Broken window screen\n\nWhen we made the firm aware of these missing / broken things they got to the appartment only bringing a toy sized frying pan with room for 1 egg, mounted only one thermostat, and brought a bowl for salad. They rudely declined the price reduction proposal that we made.\n\nI advise all travellers and people on business trips to STAY AWAY form Living Downtown.",

I sent an email the next day, pretty sure that the housekeeper found it while cleaning the apartment. The manager said that they would check it out. At the end of the days still haven't heard from them, so I send another email, the next day they still haven't answered me, so I'm emailing again to make sure they have seen my message,waiting all day to get a response but nothing so I had to call them!

(Adjuster for seat is missing, seat positioning at an angle making it uncomfortable, stabilising pads for the bike missing meaning they wobble when you ride them etc.) It's frustrating to pay an annual fee and then to not be able to attend many classes due to lack of availability and when you do attend to have to put up with old and/or broken equipment.",

I tried a session in Studio Forum and I fell in love on how the workout is being done the very first time. I tried the other Studio as well (btw, they are all centrally located) but Studio Forum is my go-to studio. The fact that it is only 15 mins away from where I am working. What really makes this studio special (for me) is it is so quiet not a typical chaos fitness studio because only maximum of 5 participants can do the workout in a session - which kinda a private class feel. In terms of the changing room and shower room. There is a small toilet inside the Studio where you can change but not do the shower. BUT in the opposite room outside the Studio (still same building) there is a big changing room and shower room - boys and girls are separated which the Booster participants are allowed to use. Tip: bring your own lock.",

All the teachers I met were super welcoming and accommodating and, even though some of the classes I attended were not marked as \"EN\" on the schedule, the teacher made sure to explain the first set in English and the second set in Schwizer D\u00fctsch.\nThank you very much and look forward to coming back next time I am in Z\u00fcrich!",

It took the \"office\" several weeks to answer and they sent a price together with a link that said \"Accept offer\". The link didn't work, whence I wrote back to get the beds confirmed or to get a new link. After several more weeks we received a mail completely similar to the first one that didn't work and responded the link didn't work, but we would like to confirm that we needed beds for the children.\nWhen we arrived there were no such beds, we then called the office who tolds ud, that the would bring the beds within 30 minutes. They didn't arrive, nor did they let us know, that they couldn't make it.\n\nThe appartement was completey under-equipped when it comes to cutlery and furniture. It was disgustingly dirty with matts of dust on many panels, garbage under the madresses and a nasty, smelly bathroom drain. The washing machine was completely broken and couldn't do any programmes. It only had (very bright) ceiling lights i.e no small / night lamps.\n\nThe \"office\" is close to impossible to reach and you will only find one person in the entire company who knows english. When actually reaching this person, he will let you know that \"You can call any time, we will be ready to meet your requirements\", but then ignore every following call you make during weekdays on all the numbers, that they use.\n\nHere is a non exhaustive list of things that were not satisfactory about our stay:\n1) Close to none customers service\n2) Dishonest employees, with only one english speaking person (who is almost impossible to reach)\n3) Filthy apartment, indluding dusty panels and closets, stained chairs, garbage under madresses, smelly bath drain\n4) Check in at the front door using the screen was not possible\n5) Multiple radiators were turned on with no thermostat mounted, whence heating and impossible to turn off.\n6) Broken toilet seat\n7) Tons of cutlery missing, including knifes, forks, plates, cutting boards, bowl, chefs knife, frying pan, oven gloves, etc\n8) Tons of missing furniture including chairs with back support, night lamps, a regularly sized table\n9) Broken washing machine\n10) Broken window screen\n\nWhen we made the firm aware of these missing / broken things they got to the appartment only bringing a toy sized frying pan with room for 1 egg, mounted only one thermostat, and brought a bowl for salad. They rudely declined the price reduction proposal that we made.\n\nI advise all travellers and people on business trips to STAY AWAY form Living Downtown.",

We had book for 4 people but only 3 towels were provided.\nYou can barely open the door to the balcony and it's full of trash around it.\nBut the worst part is that I forgot a Prada dust bag and a backpack in one of the wardrobe's drawer. I sent an email the next day, pretty sure that the housekeeper found it while cleaning the apartment. The manager said that they would check it out. At the end of the days still haven't heard from them, so I send another email, the next day they still haven't answered me, so I'm emailing again to make sure they have seen my message,waiting all day to get a response but nothing so I had to call them! The manager seemed quite uncomfortable telling me that the housekeeper is 100% sure that there was nothing in the wardrobe... My stuff had just magically disappeared...",

The taste of Taiwanese and Japanese has been recognised as top, if not the best, of the world. Their texture is also better than, say, Thai or Indian rice, in terms of stickiness and firmness. Definitely the top option if you are to make sushi or onigiri (rice ball).",

Since I stayed longer I didn\u2019t expect \u201chotel like\u201d service so it was completely fine.  My key didn\u2019t work one time and I called the manager and he showed up right away.  Automated check-in can be confusing for the first time.  They provide cleaning once a week but sometimes the cleaning ladies show up late or in different days.\n\nThe location (in Weststrasse) is top.  Many bars and great restaurants nearby.\n\nI would strongly suggest to stay here if you are planning to stay longer and didn\u2019t expect hotel/Airbnb like service.",

First they rung the doorbell, and after a couple seconds of me not answering they unlocked the door with their key card. While the door does auto-lock, there was no mechanism to lock the door from the inside. Luckily, I blocked the door with a chair every night before bed, so they were unable to get in. I'm giving them two stars for service because they were polite and let me check in early. However, I would not stay here again.",

It took the \"office\" several weeks to answer and they sent a price together with a link that said \"Accept offer\". The link didn't work, whence I wrote back to get the beds confirmed or to get a new link. After several more weeks we received a mail completely similar to the first one that didn't work and responded the link didn't work, but we would like to confirm that we needed beds for the children.\nWhen we arrived there were no such beds, we then called the office who tolds ud, that the would bring the beds within 30 minutes. They didn't arrive, nor did they let us know, that they couldn't make it.\n\nThe appartement was completey under-equipped when it comes to cutlery and furniture. It was disgustingly dirty with matts of dust on many panels, garbage under the madresses and a nasty, smelly bathroom drain. The washing machine was completely broken and couldn't do any programmes. It only had (very bright) ceiling lights i.e no small / night lamps.\n\nThe \"office\" is close to impossible to reach and you will only find one person in the entire company who knows english. When actually reaching this person, he will let you know that \"You can call any time, we will be ready to meet your requirements\", but then ignore every following call you make during weekdays on all the numbers, that they use.\n\nHere is a non exhaustive list of things that were not satisfactory about our stay:\n1) Close to none customers service\n2) Dishonest employees, with only one english speaking person (who is almost impossible to reach)\n3) Filthy apartment, indluding dusty panels and closets, stained chairs, garbage under madresses, smelly bath drain\n4) Check in at the front door using the screen was not possible\n5) Multiple radiators were turned on with no thermostat mounted, whence heating and impossible to turn off.\n6) Broken toilet seat\n7) Tons of cutlery missing, including knifes, forks, plates, cutting boards, bowl, chefs knife, frying pan, oven gloves, etc\n8) Tons of missing furniture including chairs with back support, night lamps, a regularly sized table\n9) Broken washing machine\n10) Broken window screen\n\nWhen we made the firm aware of these missing / broken things they got to the appartment only bringing a toy sized frying pan with room for 1 egg, mounted only one thermostat, and brought a bowl for salad. They rudely declined the price reduction proposal that we made.\n\nI advise all travellers and people on business trips to STAY AWAY form Living Downtown.",

At the end of the days still haven't heard from them, so I send another email, the next day they still haven't answered me, so I'm emailing again to make sure they have seen my message,waiting all day to get a response but nothing so I had to call them!
